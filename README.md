# friendFinder

##An App for finding a friend match
The app is built with two simple html pages, a home page and a page to take the survey. To find your match you, as the user, fill out your name, link a photo of yourself, and answer 10 questions/statements.

Once you submit your survey you inputs are compared to an array of other friends to find which person had a score closest to yours.
